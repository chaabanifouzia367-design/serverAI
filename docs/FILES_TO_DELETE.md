# Project Structure - Files to DELETE

## 🗑️ Safe to Delete Immediately

### 1. Python Cache Files (Auto-generated)
```
DELETE ALL:
__pycache__/ (21 directories)
*.pyc files (81 files)
```

**Why**: These are automatically generated by Python and will be recreated when needed.

**How to delete**:
```powershell
# PowerShell (run from project root)
Get-ChildItem -Path . -Recurse -Filter "__pycache__" -Directory | Remove-Item -Recurse -Force
Get-ChildItem -Path . -Recurse -Filter "*.pyc" -File | Remove-Item -Force
```

### 2. Old Upload Files (Review)
```
uploads/ (13 files) - REVIEW & CLEAN OLD
```

**Action**: Delete test/old uploads, keep recent ones.

## 🟡 Review & Clean If Old

### 3. Upload Files
```
uploads/ (13 files)
```

**Action**: Review and delete test/old upload files. Keep only recent/needed ones.

### 4. Cache Directories
```
cache_slices/ (check if old slices present)
processed/ (check if old processed files present)
```

**Action**: Clean old files, these are temporary processing directories.

## ✅ Keep (Essential)

All other files and folders in the project structure are essential:
- `app/` - Main application code
- `taskes/` - AI pipeline (newly created)
- `docs/` - Documentation
- `models/` - AI model files
- Docker files, requirements.txt, etc.
